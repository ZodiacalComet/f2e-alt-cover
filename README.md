# fimfic2epub-cover-patch

A simple and messy CLI to handle an error with canvas in [fimfic2epub] while using its CLI to download a [Fimfiction] story that doesn't have a cover.

Requires [fimfic2epub] to be installed, obiously.

Mainly made for personal use, but if someone else finds themselves needing it here it is.

## Acknowledgments

- [fimfic2epub]: Chrome/Firefox extension & npm package for improved EPUB export on fimfiction.net

    For allowing to have good epub formatted Fimfiction stories! Specially for offline reading.

To these projects, that made this script less painful to make! ~~I don't know how to make requests with urllib, help~~

- **[Requests]**: A simple, yet elegant HTTP library.
- **[Pillow]**: The Python Imaging Library adds image processing capabilities to your Python interpreter.
